# ZSBots

These are Bots I'm making for the Garry's Mod Zombie Survival gamemode. They're still in development so expect bugs, unfinished features and frequent updates. If you find a bug, be sure to report it in the Issues section.

**If the bots aren't moving then type 'nav_generate' into the console. If the console says "No valid walkable seed positions." then look at the area you want to navmesh then do 'nav_mark_walkable' and then do 'nav_generate'**

# How to install
Unzip the downloaded file and then put the folder into your "garrysmod/addons" folder.
